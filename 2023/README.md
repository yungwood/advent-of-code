# Advent of Code 2023

This repo contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

Each day's puzzle is stored in a separate folder.

My solutions are written in Python and probably quite hacky.

## Usage

Should be all self-contained scripts. If there are non-standard dependencies required for any of the solutions I will include a `requirements.txt` in the folder.

Scripts will require the puzzle input to be saved to a file and provided as an argument, like so:

```python
python3 part1.py input.txt
```
